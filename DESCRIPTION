Description: shoelati explores the associations between variables from a shoe dataset to create meaningful graphs.    The first function produces a datatable when calculating summary statistics (mean, median, etc.) for a numeric variable being grouped by to two other variables (either categorical or numeric).    The second function goes hand in hand with the first- it creates an accessible boxplot (appropriate colors and text sizes) with three variables interest- the response variable must be numeric.        The third package creates a visualization to determine the association between two numeric variables using emojis as the geom.
