# shoelati

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

shoelati is an extension of ggplot2 which makes data representations more accessible, conclusive, and fun. This package uses packages such as viridis to make the visualizations specifically more reacheable for all individauls. It also performs commmon summary functions to find trends. Finally, it demonstrates how we can use geoms such as emojis to make more fun graphs.  

## Installation

You can install the development version of shoelati from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("harvard-stat108s23/project2-group18")
```

## Examples

We can wrangle the data using unique variables to perform summary functions: 

```{r example}
library(shoelati)
library(tidyverse)

shoelati |>
  group_by(brand) |>
  summarize(mean = mean(price_usd),
            sd = sd(price_usd),
            median = median(price_usd),
            max = max(price_usd),
            min = min(price_usd),
            count = n())

```


We can also create meaningful data vidualizations:

```{r example 2}
library(viridis)

ggplot(data = shoelati, mapping = aes(x = price_usd, y = brand, color = brand)) +
  geom_violin() +
  guides(color = "none") +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
  labs(title = "How does Price Distribution vary according to Brand",
       x = "Price (USD)",
       y = "Brand") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 15))

```



What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(shoelati)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
