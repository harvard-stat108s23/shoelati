shoelati uses data on shoes collected from a particular region (last updated two months ago) to understand the relationships between the variables in the data and how they influence one another. This package makes visualizations which are more accessible, conclusive, and fun. Specifically, it uses package such as viridis to make the visualizations more accessible to all individuals, including those who suffer from colorblindness, and it increases text size. It also performs common summary functions to find trends in numeric variables after grouping or filtering by numeric or categorical variables. Finally, it demonstrates how we can use geoms such as emojis to make more fun graphs, while also uncovering how general shoe types can cluster in particular variables.  

## Installation

You can install the development version of shoelati from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("harvard-stat108s23/shoelati")
```

## Exploring the data

```{r}
#loading the libraries
library(shoelati)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

```

Let's first explore the different variables in the data and their diverse range of inputs. We can determine that `shoelati` contains 8 categorical variables and 2 numeric variables as highlighted below.
Categorical: brand, model, type, gender, color, material, general_type, and emoji
Numeric: size_us and price_usd.
The code below dives more deeply into discussing these variables and their inputs.

```{r}
summary(shoelati)
```

## Examples

We can better understand how the different variables interact/impact one another through wrangling the data and examining the changes in our response variable. In the following code, we will examine how the price of shoes varies depending on the brand we are examining. 

```{r sum-table}
shoelati |>
  group_by(brand) |>
  summarize(mean = mean(price_usd),
            sd = sd(price_usd),
            median = median(price_usd),
            max = max(price_usd),
            min = min(price_usd),
            count = n())

```


We can also create meaningful data visualizations using 'shoelati'. In the example below, we are uncovering how price varies depending on the brand we are examining. The violin plot in particular highlights these differences in distribution. 

```{r price-brand}
library(viridis)

ggplot(data = shoelati, mapping = aes(x = price_usd, y = brand, color = brand)) +
  geom_violin() +
  guides(color = "none") +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
  labs(title = "How does Price Distribution vary according to Brand",
       x = "Price (USD)",
       y = "Brand",
       caption = "Each color represents a different brand.") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 13))

```
